# Preface

Welcome along to iOS7 Day-by-Day! In September of 2013 Apple released the 7th
version of their exceedingly popular mobile operating system into the world. With
it came a new user interface appearance, new icons and lots of other little changes
for users to complain about. However, the most exciting changes were, as ever,
in the underlying APIs - with new frameworks and considerable new functionality
added to existing frameworks.

There are so many changes in fact that it's very difficult for a busy developer
to pore through the release notes to discover the features which they can take
advantage of. Therefore I wrote and published a
[daily blog series](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/blog/posts/2013/09/19/introducing-ios7-day-by-day/),
in which each article discussed a new feature, and created a sample app to
demonstrate it.

This series was very successful, and ran for a total of 24 days - covering many
parts of the new operating system, including both the big headline frameworks
and also the somewhat smaller hidden gems. The only notable omissions are the
game-related frameworks, such as SpriteKit and changes to GameCenter. This is,
unapologetically, because I have little experience of games, and also felt that
these were being covered extensively elsewhere.

This book represents the sum-total of the blog series - each chapter represents
a different post in the day-by-day series, with only minor changes. The original
posts are still available online, and may offer some additional information in
the form of comments.

If you have any comments or corrections for the book then do let me know - I'm

## Audience

Each chapter in this book is about a feature which was introduced in iOS7, and
therefore is primarily targeted at developers who have had some experience of 
building iOS apps. Having said that, non-developers familiar with iOS might be
interested in reading the new features available.

If you are new to iOS development it's probably worth reading through some of
the introductory material available elsewhere - e.g. the excellent tutorials
available on [raywenderlich.com](http://www.raywenderlich.com).

## Book layout

This book is a collection of daily blog posts, which on the most-part stand
alone. There are one or two which cross-reference each other, but they can
be read entirely independently.

The chapters aren't meant to be complete tutorials, and as such, the code snippets
within each chapter usually just highlight the more salient bits of code associated
with a particular step. However, each chapter has an accompanying working app, the
source code for which can be found on GitHub.

## Source code

Each chapter has an accompanying project which is available in the GitHub
repository at
[github.com/ShinobiControls/ios7-day-by-day](https://github.com/ShinobiControls/ios7-day-by-day).
The projects are all built using Xcode 5, and should run straight after downloading.
Any pull-requests for fixes and improvements will be greatly appreciated!
