# Afterword

24 days worth of new features is pretty impressive. And this list is by no means
exhaustive. We've covered a lot of ground, and I hope that you've learnt something
along the way.

If you have any feedback about the book or its content then I'd love to hear it - 
hit me up on twitter at [@iwantmyrealname](https://twitter.com/iwantmyrealname),
or email me [sdavies@shinobicontrols.com](mailto:sdavies@shinobicontrols.com).

The day-by-day format is a lot of fun to create, and has hopefully been useful
to you. I might well consider producing similar blog series on different topics
in the future - any suggestions or comments will be greatly appreciated.
